This was proably the most challenging project that I had to so far in this class bacuase I persoanlly stink at desinging.
I defineetly used my resources from w3schools to mdn and lots of youtube videos looking on how to use javascript for design 
purposes and it was a struggle but I know that I can take what I learn and apply it later on to my project. The approach that I used
to work with the project was to start by whiteboarding first and look on exatly what I was trying to do. Once I had figured that
out then it was just to start with HTML and start putting everything together. Then the dreaded css came along and this what 
mostly took up my time. Flexbox wasnt so bad playing around with it and I ended up getting better at it. Some things that I can
definetly work on is javascript and having it manipulate the DOM. The frustration was when something broke it did not work and I thought
that I was doing everything right but missing alot of syntax errors. The bigest wins that I got out of this was that it takes a while
on playing with your site and making it the way you want it and to always stay patient and calm and not to freak out when your code
does not work. The loss is that i think my project isnt the best of what I could do and there is alot more study that I can do and definetly 
by the end of this class then I will have a better working site.
